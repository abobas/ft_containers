# ft_containers

Project for Codam (42 Network)

This is my reimplementation of the fundamental containers added to C++ in the Standard Template Library in 1992.
The assignment comprised reimplementing all functionality, including iterator systems, that was part of the C++ '98 version.
The allocator_type template parameters weren't part of the assignment either.

The following containers (and iterator systems if eligible) are added:

- Vector
- Map
- List
- Stack
- Queue
