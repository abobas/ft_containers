# ft_containers

Project for Codam (42 Network)

This is my reimplementation of the fundamental containers added to C++ in the Standard Template Library in 1992.
The assignment comprised of reimplementing all basic functionality, including iterator systems, that was part of the C++ '98 version.

The following containers (and iterator systems if eligible) are added:

- Vector
- Deque
- Map
- Multimap
- Multiset
- Set
- List
- Stack
- Queue
