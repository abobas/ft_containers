# ft_containers

## Project

This is a project for Codam (42 Network). <br>
The assignment consisted of reimplementing the following containers added to C++ in the Standard Template Library:
- Vector
- Map
- List
- Queue
- Stack

Iterators are reimplemented as well (if applicable). <br>
Template specialization is implemented for <InputIterator> templates, like in the source code.

I finished the project on 26/8/2020 with a grade of 100%.
